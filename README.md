# RaspberryPiSecuritySystem

## What is this?
The Raspberry Pi Security System provides a method of detecting when a vulnerable entry point has been accessed. Using GrovePi sensors, the system measures the distance of the desired entrypoint and, when alarmed, will notify the owner of the system via text and Gmail of breached entry. Further, in the event that the intruder breaks the device, a server has been configured to send the alarm to the user. This ensures that the owner of the system will always be notified of breached entry.
